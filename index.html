        <h1>Coming to America</h1>
        <p><em>The</em> United States has been described as "melting pot" for its fusion of different nationalities, ethnicities and cultures. Among the total annual immigration to the U.S., refugees compose about one-tenth. Fleeing away from their countries of origin is surely tough. More than that, refugees and asylees need to face innumerable challenges when resettling as they adapt to a new culture, learn a new language, and look for work with limited resources. Every tiny change to the immigration laws could have a great effect on them. </br> </br>
        <em>By</em> employing interactive designs, this project aims to provide a more intuitive explanation of the refugee and asylum subject. In addition, it tries to understand their behavior in choosing residency, from a statistical interpretation. Interviews of refugee and specialists are conducted to explore thepolicy-making perspectives.</p>

        <p>Everyday, in Washington Heights, visitors to the <a href="http://www.nmcir.org/" target="_blank">Northern Manhattan Coalition for Immigrant Rights</a> office represent just a few of the millions of immigrant and refugee families in New York and the broader United States. Similarly, seven days a week, volunteer lawyers at <a href="http://lin-sing.org/index.htm" target="_blank">Lin-Sing Association</a> - an organization dedicated to improve Asian immigrant/refugee rights and welfare, are working hard to give dozens of asian refugees/asylum seekers a second chance to remain in America. Refugees and asylums have a tougher situation than legal immigrants in making a living. These people are willing to do the most menial jobs; and life at the bottom is nasty and brutish. Every tiny change to the immigration laws could change their lives completely.</p>

        <h3>Refugee Arrivals</h3>
        <p>Historically, the U.S. has accepted more refugees for resettlement than all other countries combined. The distribution map below shows the cumulative total from 2007 - 2012 of refugee arrivals. Only a few counties are popular choices for refugees, though the data has been processed exponentially. States like Wyoming and Montana have nearly no refugees settling there. States adjoining Mexico - California, Arizona, and Texas - have become hotspots for refugees. This is also true in Florida, which is geographically very close to Cuba. The Mexican and Cuban refugees constitute a very large percentage of refugees every year. It possibly explains why Obama was trying so hard to court Latino voters in the election 2012. </p>

        <br /> <br />
        
        <p>In fiscal year 2002, four US states resettled more than 40 percent of the refugees: California (nearly 16 percent), Washington (just under 10 percent), New York (just under 9 percent), and Florida (7 percent). Ten years later, Texas (10.5 percent), California (nearly 10 percent), and Michigan (7.9 percent), have become more popular, because of their relatively loose policies. Since 2008, it bounced back a little. But in general, the total number of refugees and asylums has been declining, as you can see in the bar chart below. </p> 
        <div id="yearly_comp"></div> 
        <br />
        <p>
          Obama's promises, however, seems no more than a campaign gimmick - over 2 million deportation happened since Obama took office in 2008. Democrats and Republicans have been debating about these issues for long. At the end of February, the <a href="http://www.ydr.com/ci_22691310/federal-release-illegal-immigrants-draws-criticism-arizona" target="_blank">release of about 300 illegal immigrants</a> from federal custody in Arizona has raised a firestorm of controversy in this volatile border state, which has some of the nation's toughest laws against illegal immigration and is home to highly vocal groups on both sides of the debate. Senior Republican officials in the state, including Governor Jan Brewer and Senator John McCain, sharply criticized the releases. But nobody from both sides thought about this - even if these people have been released from prison, it's still very hard for them to find a job or apply for legal status afterwards because of their criminal records. <br /> <br /> 

          More than that, their children's future has become a big concern. A recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/us/after-ruling-hispanics-flee-an-alabama-town.html?_r=0" target="_blank">Alabama immigration enforcement law</a> requires schools to ascertain the immigration status of students at registration. Since the announcement, officials have noticed that 5 percent of the state’s Hispanic children are absent from classrooms. It's also hard to imagine these children's lives after their parents get deported. According to Eddie Chew, one of the most authorative voluntary lawyers at Lin-Sing Association, every couple of weeks he copes with some teenages whose parents failed to obtain legal status and have been deported. Chew has witnessed how the law reform affect these families.

        <h3>Why These Counties?</h3>
        <p>When refugees make decisions about where to settle down, they need to figure out a way to make a living. Some potential factors causing the irregular distribution of refugees, as shown in the illustration above, might be population density, unemployment rates, rents and relative size of the existing ethnic/religious community. The following section tries to explain the distribution from a visual and statistical perspective. By switching between different tabs, these different factors are mapped down to the countywide level. <br /> <br />

          <div id="tabs-4">

          </div>

        </div>

        <p>A statistically meaningful method to check the relationship is to get the correlation coefficient of two variables. One often-used methods are <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/chapter4/pearson.html" target="_blank"><code>Pearson</code></a> coefficient and its p-values. The p-value roughly indicates the probability of two uncorrelated systems, for a data set larger than 500. Since the dataset here is larger than 3000, the results should be statistically reliable. The <code>Spearman</code> benchmarks monotonic relationship. Below are the computing results for the three sets of data, based on <code>Spearman</code>. More accurate results can be found <a href="http://goo.gl/eNTPO" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
        <pre><code><center>
Spearman Correlation (Arrival, Population) = 0.6104
 Spearman Correlation (Arrival, Medium Rent) = 0.4545
Spearman Correlation (Arrival, Unemployment) = 0.1003
        </center></code></pre>
        <p> 

        The analysis shows that, refugees prefer to live in big cities or crowded counties, which may offer more working opportunities at different levels. It seems contradictory that the unemployment rate is not a strong factor; but the truth may be, as Chew pointed out, refugees/asylums are not looking for the jobs that are legally on the record. Also, different from asylums, the refugees can get funding from the US refugee resettlement program comes from the State Department, largely through the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) Account. In FY 2004, the account designated $132 million for refugee admissions. Other refugees come here with the UN or other NGO as sponsors.<br /> <br />

        Rent seems also quite important for refugees, judging from the statistical relationship. For people living in large cities, rent is probably the biggest expense. In Queens, the mediam monthly rent is $1235; but people are trying really hard to save the expense. Joy Chuang has been living a small basement with another girl in Flushing Queens for around eight months. Because they are sharing the already tiny space, each of them only pays as low as $350 per month. Though hard, life is relatively safe and stable. In most states, the police has no right to request people ascertaining the immigration status, without legal reason.

        <h3>How Important Is Culture?</h3>
        <p>Living is one thing; adapting to the culture may be much harder, especially for people from non-English speaking countries. That's probably why state resettlement patterns are generally dominated by certain ethnic communities. The map below shows how ethnic groups are distributed in the states. It's quite important for the government to know that, because they sometimes misunderstands the cultures and settles refugees in the wrong places. The story about the ethnic<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/11/061211fa_fact_finnegan" target="_blank">Somalis and Bantus in Maine</a> is a good example. </p>

        <p>Calculation shows that the correlation coefficient between refugee settlement and seven ethnic communities. Considering the relatively large size of white and multi-race communities, asian community seems to be the most popular place to settle among refugees or asylums. </p>

        <p>For example, Chinatowns have become culture centers in many different cities, and these centers are well-known for cheap food and more entry-level work opportunities. In New York City, even the low-priced Chinese restaurants seem to prefer to hire Latino immigrants or refugees, at a cheaper hourly rate. They are also the most favored labor force for construction projects in most cities.

        <h3>Countries Where They Came From</h3>
        <p>Even though the US remains the world's largest country of resettlement, its refugee admissions have been steadily declining over the last decade, both in terms of the ceilings as well as the actual number. The United States foreign policies with other countries may be a major factor, which could be referred from the Russian, Iraq, and Cuba lines below.

        <h3>An Easier Way?</h3>
        <p><em>The</em> U.S. maintains a distinct <a href="http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=229" target="_blank">program</a> for asylum seekers, as opposed to resettled refugees. They are persons who have fled their countries of nationality as a result of armed conflict, violence, persecution, human rights violations, etc., and are seeking protection and immunity from forced return by the government of the country in which they are seeking asylum.The two main ways of obtaining asylum in the United States are through the affirmative process and through the defensive process. Usually the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=dab9f067e3183210VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD" target="_blank">defensive asylum-seeker</a> has been placed in removal proceedings in <a href="http://www.justice.gov/eoir/sibpages/ICadr.htm" target="_blank">Immigration Court</a>. Affirmative asylum applicants are almost never detained. They are free to live in the U.S. pending the completion of their asylum processing by the <a href="http://www.uscis.gov" target="_blank">USCIS</a> and, if found ineligible by the USCIS, then with an Immigration Judge. <br /> <br />

        However, asylum seekers in the U.S. face broad disparities in the nation’s 54 immigration courts, the outcomes of cases are influenced by the location of the court and the gender and professional backgrounds of judges, according to a 2007 <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=983946" target="_blank">study</a>  conducted by several professors. According to the analysis of 14,000 cases from 15 countries, those from China and Colombia, where conditions of political oppression or civil violence are publicly known, have a better chance of winning their cases in certain states. For instance, the study shows that someone who has fled China in fear of persecution and asks for asylum in immigration court in Orlando, Florida, has a 76 percent chance of success, while the same refugee would only have a 7 percent chance in Atlanta. Similarly, Haitians and Colombians applying for asylum have a higher chance, sometimes up to twice as good, in Miami and New York, than in other cities. This can be easily identified from the stacked area bar chart below, in which countries with more data have larger label size and area. It's very different from the refugee linechart. <br /> </p>

        <!-- Through the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/statistics/publications/ois_rfa_fr_2011.pdf" target="_blank">two programs - refugees and asylums</a>, the United States provides refuge to persons who have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution: one for refugees (persons outside the U.S. and their immediate relatives) and one for asylees (persons in the U.S. and their immediate relatives). An applicant for refugee status must live outside the United States, while an applicant seeking asylum status must live in the United States or at a U.S. port of entry.  -->

        <p>As you can see from the above analysis, the strict laws make it extremely hard for North Korean or Chinese or Colombia residents to apply for "Refugee Status," which requires applicants to physically be inside their own coutries. But once they leave their countries and successfully cross the US border, they can apply for "Asylum Status." These kinds of "tricks" have caused some privately owned and unregulated law firms in the states to grow and prosper. It makes those who really in need of protection hard to stay.

        <p>
        Last December, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/December12/AsylumFraudChargesPR.php" target="_blank">26 individuals, including six lawyers, were charged</a> in Manhattan Federal Court with participating in immigration schemes, involving hundreds of fraudulent asylum applications. The report said that these attorneys frequently instructed their clients on what to say to ensure that nothing was said that contradicted the stories the law firm had fabricated. Clients were coached to falsely testify under oath in response to the attorney’s questioning about fictitious stories of persecution. The new regulation makes those fake asylums hard to pass the application.<br /> <br />

        Mr. Wang runs a streetfood business in Manhattan, NYC. He still remembers what happened on 9/11 in 2001, when he first came here with a tourism <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1262.html" target="_blank">B-2 Visa</a> issued by China. At that time, there was a rumor, especially widely spread among Chinese, that the U.S. would tighten their immigration law because of the terrorist attack. So, Wang decided to stay. After his visa expired, he managed to apply for asylum status and waited until the government issued him a Green Card. Recently he hired a young Chinese, Mr. Chen, who arrived here just last year with the same visa Wang had come on in 2001. Chen is saving money to find a lawyer to help him with all the procedures. But he said that he is gradually losing the hope, since things have become much harder than years ago.
