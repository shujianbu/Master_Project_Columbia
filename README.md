"Refugees and asylums are persons who sought residence in the United States in order to avoid persecutions in their country of origin. Persons granted refugee status applied for admission while outside the United States. Person granted asylum applied either at a port of entry or at some point after their entry into the United States." - The Department of Homeland Security 

My Master's Project is an individual work in the form of interactive designs and video interviews. Prof. Emily Bell is my faculty adviser at Columbia Journalism School. The project is about the changing history of refugees in the United States, from 2002 to 2011.
